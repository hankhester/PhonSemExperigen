For the rest of this game you’ll see pictures like this one and you’ll
learn a name for the thing in the picture. You know how in English if
there’s one dog you say “dog” but if there are two of them you say “dogs”?
 In the language we’re learning today there’s also different ways of
 saying it if there are one or two things. So we’re going to learn how
 to say it in this language if there’s one, and also how to say it if
 there are two things.
